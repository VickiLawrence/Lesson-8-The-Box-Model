        <dt id="4"><strong>The career of Vicki Lawrence </strong></dt>
         <dd>she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter's ball. 
            A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore 
            a striking resemblance to a young Carol Burnett. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence's mother urged
             her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article.
            After receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence's father's name in the phone book, 
            called him, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and 
            Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress 
            to play her younger sister on her upcoming show. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got 
            the part at age eighteen, specifically for playing Chrissy in the <q>Carol and Sis</q> sketches. </dd>
