            <h2>Her Early Life</h2>

            <h3><em>Growing up</em></h3>

            <br>

            <p>Lawrence was born Vicki Ann Axelrad in Inglewood, California, the daughter of Anne Alene (n√©e Loyd) and 
               Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for Max Factor. The family surname was legally changed 
               to <strong><q>Lawrence</q></strong> when Vicki was young. She is a graduate of Morningside High School in Inglewood, class 
               of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a dental hygienist. She attended UCLA while on 
               The Carol Burnett Show, and changed her major to theater arts, but dropped out after two years. 
               In high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group The Young Americans. She stayed with the 
               group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, 
               performing at the Oscars, coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as Johnny Mathis and 
               Louis Armstrong, and performing on The Andy Williams Show.</p>

               <p>In her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter's ball. 
               A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking
                resemblance to a young Carol Burnett. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence's mother urged her to write a letter, 
                which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article.
               After receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence's father's name in the phone book, called him, and said 
               she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage 
               to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on her upcoming show. 
               After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got the part at age eighteen, specifically for playing 
               Chrissy in the <q>Carol and Sis</q> sketches.</p>

         <h2>Her Acting</h2>
         <article>
            <h3><em>Actress/Comedian</em></h3>

            <p>As a comedian and actress, Lawrence is best known for her work on The Carol Burnett Show, 
               of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett 
               herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After The Carol Burnett Show ended 
               in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but 
               after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.
               Her portrayal of the Mama character on The Carol Burnett Show's <q><em>The Family</em></q> sketches 
               was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom Mama's Family, elaborating on 
               the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the Eunice Higgins character for the sitcom from time 
               to time.) </p>

               <hr> The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was 
               renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the 
               renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for Vicki Lawrence & Mama: 
               A Two-Woman Show. Lawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms 
               Laverne & Shirley, Major Dad, Roseanne, Hannah Montana, and Yes, Dear. She appeared in two 
               episodes of Murder, She Wrote, playing different characters. Between the NBC and syndication 
               runs of Mama's Family, Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot Anything for Love, which aired as 
               a special on CBS that summer and co-starred Lauren Tewes and Rebeca Arthur. Lawrence has also 
               appeared with Burnett, Korman, and Tim Conway in the Burnett show retrospectives that were 
               broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV 
               special based on Nunsense Jamboree that originally aired on TNN in 1998.

            <h2>Her Music</h2>

            <h3><em>Singer & Married to Songwriter</em></h3>
            
            <p>As a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated 
               Johnny Mann's Stand Up And Cheer program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit,
               <q>The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia</q>, a song written by her first husband Bobby Russell,
                 which was released on Bell Records in November 1972. It sold over two million copies 
                and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 1973. 
                During the last episode of the sixth season of The Carol Burnett Show (March 24, 1973), 
                Lawrence received her gold record by surprise from Carol Burnett. Her first LP, The Night 
                the Lights Went Out in Georgia, was issued soon after the single went gold. The song was 
                re-recorded by Reba McEntire for her 1991 album For My Broken Heart. McEntire released the 
                track as a single to country radio in 1992 and it peaked at No. 12 on the country chart, aided 
                in part by a highly cinematic music video.</p>

               <p> <q>He Did With Me</q>, Lawrence's follow-up to <q>The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia</q>, reached 
                number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the adult contemporary music 
                charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. 
                She followed it up there with <q>Ships in the Night</q> (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed 
                one last minor U.S. chart entry on the Private Stock label with <q>The Other Woman</q> (number 81).
               In 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, Ships in the Night. The label was in the process 
               of being phased out by Arista, and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in 
               Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrence's first two LPs were released as a single 
               CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.
               She released a disco album entitled Newborn Woman late 1979. The album produced the minor disco 
               hit <q>Don't Stop the Music</q>.</p>
